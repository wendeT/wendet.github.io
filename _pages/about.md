I am a PhD candidate at Vrije University Amsterdam in [Computational Linguistics and Text Mining Lab](https://cltl.nl/). I am supervised by [Prof. dr. Piek Vossen](https://vossen.info/), [Dr. Lisa Beinborn](https://beinborn.eu/) and [Dr. Ilia Markov](https://ilia-markov.github.io/). Prior to my Ph.D. study, I completed a master's program at Addis Ababa University in Information Science and an undergrad in Computer Science and Engineering at Bahir Dara University. My PhD research focuses on extending the capabilities of large language models to new languages and scripts.
