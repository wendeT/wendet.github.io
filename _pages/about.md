I am a PhD candidate at Vrije University Amsterdam in [Computational Linguistics and Text Mining Lab](https://cltl.nl/). I am supervised by [Prof. dr. Piek Vossen](https://vossen.info/), [Dr. Lisa Beinborn](https://beinborn.eu/) and [Dr. Ilia Markov](https://ilia-markov.github.io/). Prior to my Ph.D. study, I completed a master's program in Information Science and an undergrad in Software Engineering. My PhD research focuses on extending large language models to new languages and scripts. From a theoretical standpoint, I am interested in the language-agnostic aspect of language models and how these can be leveraged to create cross-lingual models for a new language with no resources. 

**Research Area:**
* Multilingual language models
* Language Adapters
* Tokenization methods
